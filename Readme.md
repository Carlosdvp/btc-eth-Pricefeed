# Simple App to Pull the Prices for BTC and ETH

## Goal for this mini-project

- use websockets to interact with the Binance API
- use node.js for the backend code
- use axios for the api calls
- pull in price data for BTC and ETH
- Show the price changes in real time on the screen

This small project is part of a larger trading bot project, but I decided to make it it's opwn thing as this is useful to showcase the use of websockets and an external api.
